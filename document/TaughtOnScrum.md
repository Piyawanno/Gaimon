# Personal Taught on Scrum

During the international agile community has started to question and criticize
about Scrum, the Thai developer community has started to adopt the agile development
process and prefer Scrum as the way to go. The main point of the critique on
Scrum is about the procedure over the principle and the behavior of Scrum Master.
Reportedly, a team applying Scrum is mostly fixed on the Daily Scrum, Sprint Review,
Product Backlog and other rituals and forget about the core value of agile development process and ends up as a waterfall model with fancy ceremonies.
The Scrum Master behaves like a project manager in the waterfall model and
leads the team in the direction. Some people complain that in such environment
the result becomes worse that the waterfall model.

DISCLAIMER : The author never applies Scrum in any kind but has now and then
observed teams with supposedly Scrum from the distance.

Of cause, Scrum could work in an environment and in the other not depending
on the other factors likewise for the agile development process in general.
In our team, we decide not to use Scrum due to the rituals, which could be
useful but unnecessary. Because we commit ourself to agile, the process
must also be agile. No step should be fixed and strictly followed.
In a software development project, nothing is clear even the user requirement
can be changed. Hence, no matter how hard the project manager
tries, the plan will definitely be changed. On the good side, Scrum
is the template for change management. But on the bad side, Scrum could
be counter productive. If nothing is to be reported, the Daily Scrum with
the ball over handing or a meeting in general could be an unnecessary distraction.
Instead, we work together twice a week, no actual meeting. The team lead
talks to each team member about the progress and problem of the current work
and distributes the upcoming work depending on the skill and workload of
each team member. Brainstorming will be executed, if the important decision
should be made or there is issue affecting the most team members.
It sounds easy, it is also easy and intuitive. But the team member must
have a good skill set and each team member must have more or less the same level
of skill. This is the difficult part and can be achieved with a long term
training plan.

[Shit Bad Scrum Masters Say](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGbsgs611MM),
which is a parody VDO about the undesirable of Scrum Master but confirmed
to be accurate.
