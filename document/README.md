# Gaimon

Gaimon is a MVC Web-Application Framework built on top of
[Sanic](https://sanic.dev/en/), aims to provide rapid development for
Full-Stack and Cross-Platform application.

## Why Gaimon

### Rapid Development

Gaimon provides [CLI](cli/README.md) tools to accelerate the development process
of Front-End as well as Back-Office. The [Model](Model.md) in MVC of Gaimon has
a set of powerful features to create User-Form and API with minimum
code base. The [Controller](Controller.md) has the comprehensive
permission control out of the box. The [View](frontend/README.md) is
built on a simple but innovative concept to enable an easy,
extensible and structural [Front-End](frontend/FrontEndPage.md) development.
Within minutes, an usable application ready for Web, Mobile and
Desktop can be created.

### The REAL Full-Stack and Cross-Plattform

From [Back-End](REST.md) to [Front-End](frontend/FrontEndPage.md)
and [Back-Office](BackOffice.md), from (database design)[Model.md]
to [production deployment](ProductionDeployment.md), for Web,
[Mobile](MobileApplication.md) and [Desktop](DesktopApplication.md),
Gaimon is ready for all tasks with minimum external tools to
reduce the development process, the system deployment and administration.

### Single Page Application

Gaimon emphasizes and is designed for the [**Single Page Application (SPA)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) as the first class citizen.
With No Line-of-Code, the Controller provides REST-API for CRUD
out of the box. Front-End for SPA can be built under a modular
software engineering and design. Data structure and Model can be directly
imported from the Back-End to the Front-End to ensure the consistency.
The state of data, user interface and event work together in harmony.
No more mingle Frankenstein code base in Front-End development.

### Fast and Scalable

Gaimon is based on Sanic, which is an asynchronous, fast Web-Micro-Framework.
By design, Gaimon can serve enormous number of user requests concurrently.
The special work and calculation, can be implemented with
[Stateful Micro-Service](microservice/README.md) to enhance the performance.
One server is not enough? No problem, with [GaimonCloud]()
applications written with Gaimon can be scaled via mouse click.


### Extensible

The Extension written in Gaimon can be further extended with the other Extension.
With the unique [Decorator](Decorator.md) and [FormAttachment](FormAttachement.md),
the developer has an option to extend the existing Extension. The concept
can significantly reduce and relax the design work, since the future features
must not be considered now but can be implemented tomorrow without the side effect
on today work.
