# Configuration for Production

This folder will be used for deployment of Docker. All configuration files
will be deployed on the target environment excepted Password.example.json,
which should be copied to Password.json and edited and stored locally.
Before deploying Docker, DockerPreparation.py should be executed to merge
configuration files with password.
